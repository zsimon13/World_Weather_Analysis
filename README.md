# World Weather Analysis
This project was to develop an app used for traveling, that combines over 600 cities location and weather data.

## Overview and Summary
- Script was developed to first generate latitiudes and logitudes used to identify cities. From there the script used OpenWeatherMaps API to pull weather data of those cities and populate them into one place. 
- App users can then narrow down locations by inputting a min and max temperature range they would like to stay in.
- Google Maps API was then used to identify hotels/lodging within a set radius of each city and generate a map showing all relevant weather data such as conditions and tempertaure of each city. 
- Google Directions API was then used to creat a tavel map for a "road trip" through selected cities.

### Tools Used
Python, Pandas, CitiPy, SciPy, Google Maps, OpenWeatherMap adn Jupyter Notebook
